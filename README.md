It’s evident that a robust understanding of space weather is of extreme importance given our world’s increasing reliance on modern technologies. Moreover, space is a fascinating topic. That said, there is no shortage of scientific research on applying different statistical modeling techniques to this particular data set. Sunspots and related solar activities have been studied using various techniques including, multifractal analysis, correlation analysis, wavelet transforms, deep neural networks, autoregression, and much more.

Despite the varying modeling techniques, there is one phenomenon that all researchers agree on - the sun exhibits an approximate 11 year solar cycle. The solar cycle is indicated by the frequency and intensity of visible sunspots, and have proven to be quite difficult to predict. In this study, we will employ various classical time series methods in attempt to capture the implicit behavior in sunspot activity.
