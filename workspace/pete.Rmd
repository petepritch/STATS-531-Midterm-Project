## Introduction

Sunspots are massive, dark regions of strong magnetic fields on the surface of the sun. They are the result of extreme magnetic flux pushing out from within the Sun's interior [@SWPC]. This causes these areas to cool and become denser and darker than the surrounding photosphere. These regions have the potential to trigger explosive phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections. It's crucial for scientists to model sunspot behavior as solar activity can have significant effects on Earth's space environment, GPS navigation, satellite communications, power grids, and so much more.

### Literature

It's evident that a robust understanding of space weather is of extreme importance given our world's increasing reliance on modern technologies. Moreover, space is a fascinating topic. That said, there is no shortage of scientific research on applying different statistical modeling techniques to this particular data set. Sunspots and related solar activities have been studied using various techniques including, multifractal analysis, correlation analysis, wavelet transforms, deep neural networks, autoregression, and much more [@hu]. 

Despite the varying modeling techniques, there is one phenomenon that all researchers agree on - the sun exhibits an approximate 11 year solar cycle. The solar cycle is indicated by the frequency and intensity of visible sunspots, and have proven to be quite difficult to predict [@daisy]. In this study, we will employ various classical time series methods in attempt to capture the implicit behavior in sunspot activity.

## Data

Our data includes 3300 (as of February 15, 2024) observations of monthly mean relative sunspot numbers (count) from 1749 to present. The data was collected by the Swiss Federal Observatory, Zurich until 1960, then the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory. The data is readily available at the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center's (SIDC) [website](https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/datafiles). A description of the data set provided by the SIDC is given below: 

- Column 1-2: Gregorian Calender Date
- Column 3: Date in fraction of year for the middle of the corresponding month
- Column 4: Monthly mean total sunspot number
- Column 5: Monthly mean standard deviation of the input sunspot numbers from individual stations.
- Column 6: Number of observations used to compute the monthly mean total sunspot number.
- Column 7: Definitive/provisional marker. A blank indicates that the value is definitive. A '*' symbol indicates that the monthly value is still provisional and is subject to a possible revision (Usually the last 3 to 6 months).

This report will focus on uni-variate analysis, and thus we will only use column 4, monthly mean total sunspot number. 

```{r table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# Comment out the line of code for the machine you are not on...

#data <- read.csv("/Users/petepritchard/Documents/School/UM WI24/531/STATS-531-Midterm-Project/data/SN_m_tot_V2.0.csv", 
#                 sep = ";") # Mac machine

data <- read.csv("C:/Users/petep/OneDrive/Documents/School/WI24/531/STATS-531-Midterm-Project/data/SN_m_tot_V2.0.csv", 
                 sep = ";") # Windows machine

data <- data %>%
  rename(
    Year = X1749, 
    Month = X01,
    date.franction = X1749.042, 
    monthly.mean = X96.7,
    monthly.sd = X.1.0,
    monthly.obs = X.1,
    prov.marker = X1
  )

knitr::kable(data[1:5,], caption = "Monthly mean sunspot data")

## EDA

As one does in time series modeling, we start off by simply plotting the data.

```{r format_data}
# Create timestamps
start_date <- as.Date("1749-01-01") # Start date
end_date <- as.Date(Sys.Date())   # End date
timestamps <- seq(start_date, end_date, by = "month")

# Create data zoo
sun.data <- zoo(data$monthly.mean, timestamps)
```

```{r initial_plot, fig.cap=""}
plot.zoo(sun.data, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Sunspots",
         col = "mediumblue", lwd = 1)
title("Monthly Mean Sunspot Count 1749-2024")
```

From the plot in figure 1, there is no obvious trend. However, the sharp peaks seem to be regular indicating there might be some form seasonality. It's difficult to tell if the data is stationary. For a time series to be stationary, it must possess properties that do not depend on the time at which the series is observed (cite). So,a series with trends or seasonality are not stationary, but a series with cyclic behavior (but no trend or seasonality) is stationary (cite). We'll zoom into the data to get a better idea of what's going on. 

```{r}
#plotting ACF and PACF
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
acf(coredata(sun.data), lag.max = 100, main = "ACF of Monthly Sunspots short period")
pacf(coredata(sun.data), lag.max = 100, main = "PACF of Monthly Sunspots short period")
```

150 lags displays a patterned behavior in which a decaying sin wave becomes obvious, suggesting auto regression. There's no discernible pattern in the PACF plot, but there are noticeably significant lags at 2 and 18. 

```{r zoomed_plot_first5001}
# # Slice the first 100 observations of the data
# zoomed_data <- sun.data[1:500]
# 
# # Plot the sliced data
# plot.zoo(zoomed_data, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Sunspots",
#          col = "mediumblue", lwd = 1)
# title("Monthly Mean Sunspot Count (First 500 Observations)")
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[80], col = "red", lty = 2)
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[208], col = "red", lty = 2)
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[320], col = "red", lty = 2)
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[425], col = "red", lty = 2)
```


```{r zoomed_plot_first500}
# Slice the last 200 observations of the data
zoomed_data <- tail(sun.data, 200)

# Plot the sliced data
plot.zoo(zoomed_data, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Sunspots",
         col = "mediumblue", lwd = 1)
title("Monthly Mean Sunspot Count (Short Period)")
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[80], col = "red", lty = 2)
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[208], col = "red", lty = 2)
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[320], col = "red", lty = 2)
# abline(v = index(zoomed_data)[425], col = "red", lty = 2)
```

Over short term periods, it may appear that there are linear trends. However, when considering the full data, it becomes apparent that these are elements of a much broader cyclical trend. There are many successive points indicating autoregression, however the strength of the relationship changes over time with a stronger relationship occurring at the low point of the cycle. It's obvious that the variance changes. Furthermore, figure 2 highlights the general concurrences of an approximate 11 year solar cycle. 

```{r}
#plotting ACF and PACF
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
acf(coredata(zoomed_data), lag.max = 50, main = "ACF of Monthly Sunspots short period")
pacf(coredata(zoomed_data), lag.max = 50, main = "PACF of Monthly Sunspots short period")
```

```{r}
annual_short <- diff(coredata(zoomed_data))

# Plot the sliced differenced data
plot.zoo(annual_short, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Sunspots",
         col = "mediumblue", lwd = 1)
title("Differenced Monthly Mean Sunspot Count (Short Period)")
```

After applying seasonal differenceing, the changes in variance becomes very apparent in the residual plot. 

```{r}
#plotting ACF and PACF
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
acf(coredata(annual_short), lag.max = 50, main = "ACF of Monthly Sunspots short period")
pacf(coredata(annual_short), lag.max = 50, main = "PACF of Monthly Sunspots short period")
```


$$Y_t = \phi_1 Y_{n-1} +\phi_2 Y_{n-2} + \dots + \phi_p Y_{n-p} + $$

## SARIMA 

A seasonal ARIMA model (SARAMA) is construed by including additional season terms in a ARIMA models. It is defined as follows:
$$SARMA(p,q)\times(P,Q)_m$$
Where *m* = number of observations per year. For example, a general $SARMA(p,q)\times(P,Q)_{12}$ model for monthly data is
$$\phi(B)\Phi(B^{12})(Y_n-\mu)=\psi(B)\Psi(B^{12})\epsilon_n,$$
where $\epsilon_n$ is a white noise process and
$$
\begin{aligned}
 \mu = \exp \\
 \phi(x) = 1-\phi_1x-\dots-\phi_px^p, \\
 \psi(x) = 1+\psi_1x+\dots+\psi_qx^q, \\
 \Phi(x) = 1-\Phi_1x-\dots-\Phi_Px^P, \\
 \Psi(x) = 1+\Psi_1x+\dots+\Psi_Qx^Q. \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The seasonal part of an AR or MA model can be discovered through the seasonal lags of the PACF and ACF. 

```{r}
#plotting ACF and PACF
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
forecast::Acf(coredata(sun.data), lag.max = 100, main = "ACF of Monthly Sunspots")
forecast::Acf(coredata(sun.data), type = "partial", lag.max = 100, main = "PACF of Monthly Sunspots")
```

## Spectral Analysis

```{r sdf, fig.cap="Spectral estimation using parametric and non-parametric methods."}
sunspot_ar <- spec.ar(coredata(zoomed_data), plot = FALSE) # parametric estimation based on 
                                              # AR model
sunspot_np <- spectrum(coredata(zoomed_data  ), spans = c(5, 5), plot = FALSE) # nonparametric
plot(sunspot_ar$freq, sunspot_ar$spec, type = "l", log = "y", 
     ylab = "Spectral Power", xlab = "Frequency (cycles per observation)", 
     bty = "l", col = 2)
lines(sunspot_np$freq, sunspot_np$spec, lty = 2, col = 4)
legend("topright", c("parametric", "nonparametric"), lty = 1:2, bty = "n")
```
```{r}
domain_freq_ar <- sunspot_ar$freq[which.max(sunspot_ar$freq)]
domain_freq_np <- sunspot_np$freq[which.max(sunspot_np$freq)]

period_ar <- 1/(domain_freq_ar*12)
period_np <- 1/(domain_freq_np*12)

print(period_ar)
print(period_np)
```



```{r}
autoplot(decompose(sunspots))
```

We cannot get much out of the seasonal component, it also has the highest variation. The remainder component in the bottom panel is what is left over when the seasonal and trend components have been subtracted from the data.

The grey bars to the right of each panel show the relative scales of the components. Each grey bar represents the same length but because the plots are on different scales, the bars vary in size.

## Lowess

```{r}
plot(coredata(sun.data), xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Sunspots",
         col = "grey", lwd = 1)
lines(lowess(coredata(sun.data), f = 0.001), lwd = 2, col = 4)
lines(lowess(coredata(sun.data)), lty = 2, lwd =2, col = 2)
```

## Future Extensions

There are numerous avenues one could take exploring this data set. It would be interesting to see how more modern machine/deep learning methods perform in comparison to classical time series approaches. The 11-year solar cycle is indeed glaring, however perhaps it's so bright that it's caused researchers to overlook hidden seasonal trends?
