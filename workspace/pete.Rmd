## Introduction

Sunspots are massive, dark regions of strong magnetic fields on the surface of the sun. They are the result of extreme magnetic flux pushing out from within the Sun's interior [@SWPC]. This causes these areas to cool and become denser and darker than the surrounding photosphere. These regions have the potential to trigger explosive phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections. It's crucial for scientists to model sunspot behavior as solar activity can have significant effects on Earth's space environment, GPS navigation, satellite communications, power grids, and so much more.

### Literature

It's evident that a robust understanding of space weather is of extreme importance given our world's increasing reliance on modern technologies. Moreover, space is a fascinating topic. That said, there is no shortage of scientific research on applying different statistical modeling techniques to this particular data set. Sunspots and related solar activities have been studied using various techniques including, multifractal analysis, correlation analysis, wavelet transforms, deep neural networks, autoregression, and much more [@hu]. 

Despite the varying modeling techniques, there is one phenomenon that all researchers agree on - the sun exhibits an approximate 11 year solar cycle. The solar cycle is indicated by the frequency and intensity of visible sunspots, and have proven to be quite difficult to predict [@daisy]. In this study, we will employ various classical time series methods in attempt to capture the implicit behavior in sunspot activity.

## Data

Our data includes 3300 (as of February 15, 2024) observations of monthly mean relative sunspot numbers (count) from 1749 to present. The data was collected by the Swiss Federal Observatory, Zurich until 1960, then the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory. The data is readily available at the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center's (SIDC) [website](https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/datafiles). A description of the data set provided by the SIDC is given below: 

- Column 1-2: Gregorian Calender Date
- Column 3: Date in fraction of year for the middle of the corresponding month
- Column 4: Monthly mean total sunspot number
- Column 5: Monthly mean standard deviation of the input sunspot numbers from individual stations.
- Column 6: Number of observations used to compute the monthly mean total sunspot number.
- Column 7: Definitive/provisional marker. A blank indicates that the value is definitive. A '*' symbol indicates that the monthly value is still provisional and is subject to a possible revision (Usually the last 3 to 6 months).

This report will focus on uni-variate analysis, and thus we will only use column 4, monthly mean total sunspot number.

  )

## EDA

As one does in time series modeling, we start off by simply plotting the data.

```{r format_data, echo=FALSE}
# Create timestamps
start_date <- as.Date("1749-01-01") # Start date
end_date <- as.Date(Sys.Date())   # End date
timestamps <- seq(start_date, end_date, by = "month")

# Create data zoo
sun.data <- zoo(data$monthly.mean, timestamps)
```

```{r}
# Create timestamps
start_date <- c(1749, 1) # Start date

# Create ts
ss <- ts(data$monthly.mean, start = start_date, frequency = 12)
```

```{r initial_plot, fig.cap="Time series plot of all mean sunspot data from sample", echo=FALSE}
ggtsdisplay(ss, lag.max = 300, main = "Monthly Mean Sunspot Count 1749-2024", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Sunspots", 
            theme = theme_bw())
```

From the plot in figure 1, there is no obvious trend. However, the sharp peaks seem to be regular indicating there might be some form seasonality. It's difficult to tell if the data is stationary. For a time series to be stationary, it must possess properties that do not depend on the time at which the series is observed (cite). So,a series with trends or seasonality are not stationary, but a series with cyclic behavior (but no trend or seasonality) is stationary (cite). We'll zoom into the data to get a better idea of what's going on. 

The sample autocorrelation and partial correlation plots in fig.1 also provide us with some insight. The sample correlation, also known as the ACF, if defined by:

$$\rho_h=\rho(y_{1:N}^*)=\frac{\gamma_h}{\gamma_0}$$

250 lags displays a patterned behavior in which a decaying sin wave becomes obvious, suggesting that future values of the series are correlated with past values. Ultimately, this process in non-stationary. There's no discernible pattern in the PACF plot, but there are noticeably significant lags. 

```{r zoomed_plot_first500, fig.cap="Last 200 observations of sample data. Dotted red lines denote the start/stop of solar cycle"}
zoom_ss <- tail(ss, 200)

# Plot the sliced data
plot(zoom_ss, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Mean Sunspots",lwd = 1)
title("Monthly Mean Sunspot Count (Short Period)")
abline(v = index(zoom_ss)[20], col = "red", lty = 2)
abline(v = index(zoom_ss)[150], col = "red", lty = 2)
```

Over short term periods, it may appear that there are linear trends. However, looking back at the full data, it becomes apparent that these are elements of a much broader cyclical trend. There are many successive points indicating auto-regression, however the strength of the relationship changes over time with a stronger relationship occurring at the low point of the cycle. This shows an obvious change in variance. Furthermore, figure 2 highlights the general consensus of an approximate 11 year solar cycle. 

Now we'll difference for trend and seasonality, and have a look at the ACF and PACF behavior to asses what non seasonal terms could work in our model.

```{r both_diff}
ss.rdiff.sdiff <- diff(diff(ss, lag=12))
ggtsdisplay(ss.rdiff.sdiff)
```

```{r, fig.cap="48 lags on the basis of ACF and PACF of the 12th differences"}
acf2(ss.rdiff.sdiff, 48, main = "Seasonal and Trend Differenced Sunspot Data")
```




$$Y_t = \phi_1 Y_{n-1} +\phi_2 Y_{n-2} + \dots + \phi_p Y_{n-p} + $$

### Spectral Analysis

Given the cyclical nature of this time series, a formal investigation of the frequency domain is appropriate. A time series can be written as something called a **Fourier transform**, a sum of since and consine functions at varying frequencies (cite). The coefficients corresponding to the since and cosine at each frequency are called **frequency components**. Identifying which frequencies have large and small components can help select appropriate models and help us asses whether or not our models are doing an adequate job at describing our data.   

We will use the spectral density function to identify the large frequency components of our data. The spectral density function is written as: 

$$\lambda(\omega) = \sum_{h=-\infty}^{\infty}\gamma_h e^{-2\pi i\omega h}$$

```{r sdf, fig.cap="Spectral estimation using parametric and non-parametric methods."}
sunspot_ar <- spec.ar(coredata(sun.data), plot = FALSE) # parametric estimation based on 
                                              # AR model
sunspot_np <- spectrum(coredata(sun.data), spans = c(5, 5), plot = FALSE) # nonparametric
plot(sunspot_ar$freq, sunspot_ar$spec, type = "l", log = "y", 
     ylab = "Spectral Power", xlab = "Frequency (cycles per observation)", 
     bty = "l", col = 2)
lines(sunspot_np$freq, sunspot_np$spec, lty = 2, col = 4)
legend("topright", c("parametric", "nonparametric"), lty = 1:2, bty = "n")
```

```{r}
domain_freq_ar <- sunspot_ar$freq[which.max(sunspot_ar$spec)]
domain_freq_np <- sunspot_np$freq[which.max(sunspot_np$spec)]

period_ar <- 1/(domain_freq_ar*12)
period_np <- 1/(domain_freq_np*12)

print(period_ar)
print(period_np)
```

Both the parametric and non-parametric spectral give roughly the same max frequencies of **0.008** and **0.0077** respectively. We will use the formula, $\frac{1}{\omega\times12}$ where $\omega$ = frequency to translate the values from the **frequency domain** back to the **time domain**. Note that we multiply $\omega$ by 12 since we are dealing with monthly data. This equates out to be **10.396** years for the AR and **10.817** for the nonparametric methods. These results are consistent with the 11-year solar cycle. 

```{r}
autoplot(decompose(sunspots))
```

We cannot get much out of the seasonal component, it also has the highest variation. The remainder component in the bottom panel is what is left over when the seasonal and trend components have been subtracted from the data.

The grey bars to the right of each panel show the relative scales of the components. Each grey bar represents the same length but because the plots are on different scales, the bars vary in size.

## Model Selection

### SARIMA 

A seasonal ARIMA model (SARAMA) is construed by including additional season terms in a ARIMA models. It is defined as follows:
$$SARMA(p,q)\times(P,Q)_m$$
Where *m* = number of observations per year. For example, a general $SARMA(p,q)\times(P,Q)_{12}$ model for monthly data is
$$\phi(B)\Phi(B^{12})(Y_n-\mu)=\psi(B)\Psi(B^{12})\epsilon_n,$$
where $\epsilon_n$ is a white noise process and

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \mu = \exp && \\
 \phi(x) = 1-\phi_1x-\dots-\phi_px^p,&& \\
 \psi(x) = 1+\psi_1x+\dots+\psi_qx^q,&& \\
 \Phi(x) = 1-\Phi_1x-\dots-\Phi_Px^P,&& \\
 \Psi(x) = 1+\Psi_1x+\dots+\Psi_Qx^Q.&& \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The seasonal part of an AR or MA model can be discovered through the seasonal lags of the PACF and ACF. Considering what we already know from literature and confirmed by our analysis, we will let $m=132$. We will consider the ACF and PACF from figure () to estimate values for $p,q,P,Q$. Then we will select a second model using a more algorithmic approach called grid search and compare the performance of both. Grid search is used to find optimal hyper parameters of a model which results in the most accurate fitting.  


### Grid Search

```{r}
aic_table <- function(data,P,Q){
  table <- matrix(NA,(P+1),(Q+1))
  for(p in 0:P) {
    for(q in 0:Q) {
      table[p+1,q+1] <- arima(data,order=c(p,1,q),
                              seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,0),
                                              period=132))$aic
    }
  }
  dimnames(table) <- list(paste("AR",0:P, sep=""), 
    paste("MA",0:Q,sep=""))
  table
}
ss_aic_table <- aic_table(ss,2,2)
require(knitr)
kable(ss_aic_table,digits=2)
```

Akaike's information criterion. Minus twice the maximized log likelihood plus twice the number of parameters.

$$AIC=-2\times\ell(\theta^*)+2D$$

## Future Extensions

There are numerous avenues one could take exploring this data set. It would be interesting to see how more modern machine/deep learning methods perform in comparison to classical time series approaches. The 11-year solar cycle is indeed glaring, however perhaps it's so bright that it's caused researchers to overlook hidden seasonal trends? 


```{r test, seasonal_diff}
# Create timestamps
start_date <- c(1749, 1) # Start date

# Create ts
mean.ss <- ts(data$monthly.mean, start = start_date, frequency = 12)
mean.ss.sdiff <- diff(mean.ss, lag = 12, differences = 1)
ggtsdisplay(mean.ss.sdiff)
```

The ACF is decaying rapidly during zero, indicating some trend in the series. In the PACF there are signficant spikes. 

```{r classic_diff}
ss.sdiff <- diff(ss, lags = 128)
ggtsdisplay(ss.sdiff)
```

```{r both_diff}
mean.ss.rdiff.sdiff <- diff(diff(mean.ss, lag=132))
ggtsdisplay(mean.ss.rdiff.sdiff)
```
