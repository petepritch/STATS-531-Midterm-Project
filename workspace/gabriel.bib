  abstract={This paper provides an overview of the threat of intense geomagnetic storms created by solar activity to high voltage power grids on the Earth. Given a description of the time and spatial variation of the geomagnetic field (past, present or future), it is possible to model the response of any specific high-voltage grid with a high level of accuracy. It is also clear from the available data that the higher the voltage of the AC power system, the more vulnerable that system is to a particular geomagnetic storm. Given the ability to model and with an understanding of transformer behavior, it is possible to design protection for high-voltage grids against this unique threat.},
